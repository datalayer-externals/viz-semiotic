## Annotations

All frames have annotation capabilities that let you easily deploy
[react-annotation](https://react-annotation.susielu.com/). There is also built-in support for
automatic label adjustment using [labella.js](http://twitter.github.io/labella.js/).

All frames takes a prop \`annotations\` which is an array of annotation objects:

```jsx
<XYFrame annotations={[{ type: "react-annotation", label: "a note" }]} />
```

This array of annotations is sent to **both** an:

- `svgAnnotationRules` function which renders in an SVG layer
- `htmlAnnotationRules` function which renders in an HTML layer

This allows for the creation of graphical elements in both SVG & HTML for the same annotation type.

There are built-in annotation types handled in the default `htmlAnnotationRules` and
`svgAnnotationRules` functions on all frames that let you simply pass an array of settings to the
`annotations` prop without having to write custom rendering functions.

Otherwise, you can pass your own `htmlAnnotationRules` and `svgAnnotationRules` to create completely
[custom rendering logic](#custom-annotation-rules) based on the annotation type.

## Built-in Annotation Types

Each of the following options is a type of annotation that can be passed to the `annotations` prop:

```jsx
<XYFrame annotations={[{ type: "react-annotation", label: "a note" }, {type: "highlight"}}]]} />
```

A detailed example of a single chart with annotations and rich information display. It leverages the
`DividedLine` component and built-in annotation handling to reproduce
