The [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/)’s (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidlines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) are detailed standards that help developers ensure their work is perceivable, operable, and understandable to all people regardless of their disability status. Currently, W3C's recommendation for charts is to include a short text alternative and a long description.

Anyone who has worked in data visualization knows that we are technically capable of so much more. Interactive charts made with scalable vector graphics (SVG) can support features like keyboard navigability and labels for screenreaders. A few individuals and libraries have begun to explore and implement accessible features for some use cases.

Semiotic has taken up the challenge of making charts accessible by default.

There is much work still to be done. We have not yet figured out a keyboard navigation pattern for force-directed graphs, for example. And one charting library alone cannot create an ecosystem of consistent, predictable interactions across the web. But by prioritizing accessibility and building a community of like-minded people, we can make accessible data visualization a default rather than an edge case.

## What Semiotic does

Semiotic is striving to build a more inclusive web by baking perceivability and operability into the library. Semiotic will:

- Use the chart title you provide to add an ARIA label to the chart
- Add ARIA labels to the pieces on your chart based on the formatting functions you provide for the x and y axis labels
- Move focus and the tooltip between pieces with the left and right arrow keys after a user has focused on the chart. Currently the tooltip focuses on each piece in turn, so make sure your tooltipContent function allows for either piece hover or shared hover annotation

As explained above, there are no standards that describe how keyboard navigability or ARIA labels should work for interactive charts. Therefore, the creators of Semiotic **cannot** guarantee that charts made with Semiotic will meet any particular accessibility criteria.

## What you should do

Semiotic is a very flexible library that can be mixed and remixed to create almost anything. This means that much of the power lies with the developer. In order to make your work more accessible, you should also consider:

- Color palette: There are many types of color blindness. Use colors with a high contrast ratio and consider what additional visual cues could differentiate variables ([W3 reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=111%2C314%2C141#use-of-color)). Consider using a Chrome extension like [Colorblinding](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblinding/dgbgleaofjainknadoffbjkclicbbgaa?hl=en) to check your work.
- Animation: Nothing should flash more than three times in a second ([W3 reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=111%2C314#three-flashes-or-below-threshold)). Allow users to view and interact with content at their own pace ([W3 reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=111%2C314%2C141#enough-time)).
- Other ways to present the same information: use a text alternative like a description or a table in addition to your beautiful chart ([W3 reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=111%2C314%2C141#non-text-content)).

## Help us make charts work for everyone

No matter who you are or why you are reading this, you can help build a more inclusive data visualization community.

- **Developers**: make GitHub issues and pull requests to improve the Semiotic library
- **Accessibility experts**: if web accessibility issues affect you personally or you work professionally on web accessibility, please email melanie.mazanec@gmail.com with feedback or [help write standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZF6rygbqf8xPSmjiBQuImd9DwS3v7Rjlqs3DBfgVcm4/edit?usp=sharing) for accessible data vis
- **Designers**: give your users an opportunity to provide feedback to you and pass it along in the form of GitHub issues on the Semiotic repo
- **UX experts**: if your team uses Semiotic, conduct usability tests for accessibility and report the results to the Semiotic team
