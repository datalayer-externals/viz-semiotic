`<Mark>` is a simple component that instantiates different SVG elements depending on the `markType`
but also other attributes sent. So, for example, a markType of `rect` will usually result in an SVG
rectangle but if you set `renderMode="sketchy"` it will return two SVG paths. All display elements
are wrapped in a `<g>` and Mark does have a limited drag-and-drop context. This will probably
eventually be its own library in the future. You would pass a Mark any of the native SVG properties
you would expect of the markType you intend to render, and Mark will adjust those if the final
product is not an element that supports it (such as "r" when the actual rendered element is a path).
By default Marks will try to make an animated transition from one state to another, using simple
`d3-transition` rules.

```js
<Mark markType="circle" r={5} cx={150} cy={150} style={{ fill: "red" }} />
```

## General

### markType: { _string_ }

A required property that sets the SVG equivalent element that this mark will represent, which
accepts all SVG standard elements except `ellipse` and `polygon` as well as pseudo markTypes like
`horizontalBar` and `verticalBar` which are easier to place that top-left rects that are drawn down.

```html
<mark markType="rect" ... />
```

### renderMode: { _string_ }

Mark ship with one kinds of renderMode, `sketchy`. If set to `sketchy` you'll get a jittered outline
and a fill made of individual lines, which doesn't work great for very complex shapes. To enable
renderMode, you need to pass a `sketchyGenerator` prop to the mark that uses an SVG generator that
matches the pattern of [roughjs](https://roughjs.com/). If you want to enable more options found in
roughjs, you can pass an object to renderMode with a signature of
`{ renderMode: "sketchy", ...roughSettings }`.

```jsx
import { generator } from "roughjs/dist/rough.es5.umd.js"

<mark renderMode="sketchy" sketchyGenerator={generator} ... />
```
