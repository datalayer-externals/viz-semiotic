Spark frames are based on sparklines, there is a `Spark*` equivalent to the three frames that will render the frame as a `<span>` so it can be placed in a `<p>`. Its height (and width if not set) are based on the computed `line-height` of the line it is embedded in. By default, all Spark frames have `margin: 0` regardless of whether they have titles or axes, if you pass an explicit margin prop, you can override this.

`<SparkNetworkFrame />` is a wrapper around NetworkFrame. Some of the built-in defaults of the frame are different from the usual NetworkFrame:

- `networkType` has the following default settings (in order to make the network drawing work best in such a small space):

```
      edgeStrength: 2
      edgeDistance: 5
      nodePadding: 1
      nodeWidth: 5
      groupWidth: 4
```

- `nodeSizeAccessor` has a default setting of `2` for small spark-sized nodes.

`<SparkXYFrame />` is a wrapper around XYFrame. It also has a slightly different default for the `axes` prop:

- `axes` will by default be modified so that any passed axes will have `tickFormat: () => ""` set to hide ticks and `baseline: false`. If you pass a setting for either of these you can override these defaults.

`<SparkOrdinalFrame />` is a wrapper around OrdinalFrame. Its only difference in defaults is the margin settings shared by all spark frames.
